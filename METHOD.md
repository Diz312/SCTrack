## Method

### 1. Application Architecture

The application will have a modular, component-based architecture, integrating Flask as the backend server and React.js as the frontend framework. The core components include:

- **Flask Backend**: Handles API requests, serves initial HTML/JS, and manages data loading and transformations.
- **React.js Frontend**: Provides an interactive, user-friendly interface for filtering and displaying the supply chain graph.
- **D3 Visualization Layer**: Visualizes the supply chain graph with nodes and edges on a Google Maps background, sized and positioned based on node data.
- **Data Persistence and Configuration**:
  - **Pickle Files**: Store graph data for efficient loading and manipulation.
  - **YAML Configuration**: Store app settings, including available filters, node types, and UI behaviors.

### 2. Flask Backend

#### 2.1 Data Handling and Transformation

- **Graph Data Loading**: A dedicated module will handle loading and manipulating the graph data. This module will:
  - Load graph data from a pickle file.
  - Expose functionality to convert the graph data into a JSON format suitable for D3 and React.
  - Allow easy updates by transforming and repickling the data as needed.

- **YAML Configuration Loader**: A separate YAML parser will handle configuration data. Flask endpoints will read this configuration file at runtime, allowing dynamic changes to filter options and app behaviors without needing hardcoded values.

#### 2.2 API Endpoints

The backend will expose several endpoints, including:
  - **/api/graph**: Serves the graph data to the frontend in JSON format.
  - **/api/config**: Provides the frontend with filter options and UI configuration based on the YAML file.
  - **/api/refresh**: Triggers data reload from the pickle file and sends the updated data to the frontend.

#### 2.3 Data Manipulation Module

A backend script will provide:
  - Unpickling of the graph data into a manipulatable format (e.g., text or CSV).
  - Repickling capabilities to save any changes made to node attributes.
  - This will allow easy updates to the graph data without directly altering the pickle file in production.

### 3. React.js Frontend

#### 3.1 Component Structure

The frontend will follow a modular component design, including:
  - **Map Component**: Displays the Google Maps background and manages geospatial positioning of nodes.
  - **Graph Component**: Uses D3 to render the graph on top of the map, adjusting node size and positioning based on traffic data.
  - **Filter Component**: Renders dynamically configurable radio buttons, receiving available filter options from the YAML file.
  - **Navigation Pane**: Located on the left, it will allow future components and extensions to be added.

#### 3.2 D3 Integration

D3 will be integrated with React via the `useEffect` hook to manage graph rendering:
  - **Node Sizing**: Based on supply chain traffic volume.
  - **Graph Refresh**: When filter criteria are adjusted, a refresh button will call the `/api/refresh` endpoint to update the displayed graph based on new filter selections.

Let me know if this covers the architecture as you envisioned. Once confirmed, Iâ€™ll proceed with further details on the implementation and database schema setup in the next part.
